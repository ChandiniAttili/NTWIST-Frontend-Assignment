# My Frontend Mini Project
 
## About This Project
This is a small website I made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has three pages. I did not use any big libraries or frameworks. I made this to practice my frontend skills.
 
## What Each Page Does
- **index.html**: This page has a contact form. You can type your name, email, and a message. It checks if you filled everything correctly. It also shows how much time you spent filling the form. After you send the message, it says thank you and clears the form. There is also a star rating where you can rate from 1 to 5 stars.
- **sort.html**: This page shows a list of names. There is a button to sort the names in order (A to Z). The sorting happens without reloading the page.
- **faq.html**: This page has some common questions and answers. You can click on a question to see the answer. This page does not use any JavaScript, only HTML and CSS.
 
## How the Folders Are Organized
```
project-root/
├── index.html        # Contact form page
├── faq.html          # FAQ page
├── sort.html         # Sortable list page
├── assets/
│   ├── css/          # CSS files (styles)
│   └── js/           # JavaScript files (scripts)
└── README.md         # This file
```
 
## How to Open and Use
1. Find the file called `index.html` in the project folder.
2. Double-click it. It will open in your web browser.
3. You can also open `sort.html` and `faq.html` the same way.
4. Try out the form, sorting, and FAQ!
 
## What I Learned
- How to make a form and check if it is filled correctly.
- How to use JavaScript to change things on the page.
- How to use CSS for layout and make the website look nice on phones and computers.
- How to make a simple FAQ without JavaScript.
 
Thank you for looking at my project!
